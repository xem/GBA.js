Debugger,
the no$gba debugger is a programming tool for professional developers.
To support hobby programmers, there's also a nice-price shareware debug
version available.
If you are a developer, please see no$gba homepage for more info.
If you aren't, please read the note below.

CAUTION:
The shareware & commecial versions include debugging features which are
useful for programmers ONLY, these versions are COMPLETELY USELESS for
gamers. That means, if you are a gamer, then you do NOT need to buy (or
steal) anything, you already GOT EVERYTHING you need FOR FREE.

Installation notes,
unzip the no$gba package into a new/blank folder (or into your existing
no$gba folder when installing an update) and start the no$gba.exe file.
For more info about additional files see built-in help. The program should
work (slowly) on any 80386SX (and up).

Uninstallation,
no$gba will eventually create some files and subdirectories in the no$gba
folder, aside from that it does not create or modify other files/registry
settings (except nocashio, see below). If no longer needed, just delete the
no$gba folder with all files/folders in it.

Nocashio,
a parallel port driver for windows NT/2K/XP, no$gba prompts you if you want
to install the driver (only when -if- accessing the parallel port under
NT/2K/XP). When -if- it is installed, you can uninstall it in no$gba
utility menu.
